### Mahesh Dawedar

This repository contains projects for Udacity's [Predictive Analytics for Business Nanodegree]

###  1: [Problem Solving with Advanced Analytics by Alteryx]
Learn a structured framework for solving problems with advanced analytics. Learn to select the most appropriate analytical methodology. Learn linear regression.

- Project: [Predicting Diamond Prices]
- Project: [Predicting Catalog Demand]

### 2: [Creating an Analytical Dataset by Alteryx]
Understand the most common data types. Understand the various sources of data. Make adjustments to dirty data to prepare a dataset. Identify and adjust for outliers. Learn to write queries to extract and analyze data from a relational database.

- Project: [Data Cleanup]
- Project: [Create Report from Database (SQL)]


### 3: [Classification Models by Alteryx]
You will use classification models, such as logistic regression, decision tree, forest, and boosted, to make predictions of binary and non-binary outcomes.

- Project: [Predicting Default Risk]

###  4: [A/B Testing]
Understand the fundamentals of A/B testing, including experimental design, variable selection, and analyzing and interpreting results.

- Project: [A/B Test a New Menu Launch]

###  5: [Time Series Forecasting]
Understand trend, seasonal, and cyclical behavior of time series data. Use time series decomposition plots. Build ETS and ARIMA models.

- Project: [Forecast Video Game Sales]

###  6: [Segmentation and Clustering]
Understand the difference between localization, standardization, and segmentation. Scale data to prepare a dataset for cluster modeling. Use principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of variables for cluster model. Build and apply a k-centroid cluster model. Visualize and communicate the results of a cluster model.
Then complete a capstone project combining techniques learned throughout the program.

- Project: [Predictive Analytics Capstone]
